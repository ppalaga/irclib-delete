IRClib is client library for Internet Relay Chat (IRC) licensed under the 
    * GNU Lesser General Public License (see COPYING_LGPL),
    * Apache License, Version 2.0 (see COPYING_AL) and
    * Eclipse Public License (see COPYING_EPL).

IRClib requires Java Runtime Environment 1.2 or later. It requires
JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extensions) until J2RE 1.3; J2RE 1.4 already
includes JSSE and hence doesn't require JSSE. You can download JSSE
from http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index-103.html.

        - org.schwering.irc.manager	is a wrapper of the core library classes 
                                    that is more abstract, but also more 
                                    bloated than the core library
